This SDK is targeted to the following tools:
- XCode 11.4+
- CocoaPods 1.9

- React Native >=0.60.0

## Installation

Install and link the module:

`$ npm install inbrain-surveys --save`

### Extra steps iOS

### Show the surveys webview
```javascript
inbrain.showSurveys() : Promise<void>
```

### Get the rewards (Useful for server less app)
```javascript
inbrain.getRewards() : Promise<InBrainReward[]>
```

### Confirm a list of rewards (Useful for server less app)
```javascript
inbrain.confirmRewards(rewards: InBrainReward[]) : Promise<void>
```
* rewards: List of rewards to confirm

### Check if Native Surveys are available
```javascript
inbrain.checkSurveysAvailable() : Promise<boolean>
```

### Get the Native Surveys available
```javascript
inbrain.getNativeSurveys() : Promise<InBrainNativeSurveys[]>
```

### Show a Native Survey
```javascript
inbrain.showNativeSurvey(id: string) : Promise<void>
```

### On webview dismissed
```javascript
inbrain.setOnCloseListener(callback: () => void) 
```
* callback: callback to perform when it happens

Note: Calling this method multiple times will override the previous listener.

### On webview dismissed from page

Note: Calling this method multiple times will override the previous listener.

## Troubleshoots
### [BUILD TIME] 'InBrainSurveys_SDK_Legacy/InBrainSurveys_SDK_Legacy-Swift.h' file not found
This problem usually happens if the framework is not set in the Embedded Binaries, or if the framework doesn't have the target set to `inbrain-surveys` See above for set up.
Clean and build the project after changes.

### [RUNTIME] Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib
This problem can happen if your project doesn't have the Swift standard libraries included. Set the 'Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries' to yes in your target to fix it.
Clean and build the project after changes.
This problem also consistently appears when usinx XCode10
